Game: Learn to Waltz

Description:
Learn how to waltz by navigating your Avatar around the dance floor without bumping into other dancing couples, chairs, tables or moving off the dance floor.

There are five basic Waltz steps. The game begins with the avatar moving off in a basic step. from there the player must choose the best steps to use via keyboard navigation in order to amass points throughout the song. Points are amassed by the players ability to remain on the dance floor without bumping into objects or other dancers.

Each level grows in complexity with more dancers, faster song and smaller dance floor.
